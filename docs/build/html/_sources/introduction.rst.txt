Introduction
==================

Observing System Simulation experiments (OSSEs) to subsample high-resolution model output as if by gliders, ships, or other in situ platforms



This package takes an input trajectory (e.g., the path of an ocean glider), subsamples output from a high-resolution ocean simulation along that trajectory, and returns a set of subsampled variables (e.g., standard physical variables temperature, salinity, velocity; derived physical quantities such as steric height; biogeochemical quantities if available). We envision this package having two potential uses: 1) designing in situ sampling strategies, and 2) interpreting in situ data in the context of a high resolution model.
